## Week 6 - Project/client introduction, group project management
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I studied teamwork structures and project initiation processes to prepare for our group project and client introduction. I watched a LinkedIn Learning video about productive Agile meetings and daily stand-ups, which explained how a team forms roles, plans work, runs short and structured activities, and maintains efficiency through good meeting practices.

## Estimated Hours
7 hours
## Content Insights
I learned how Agile teams organise themselves at the beginning of a project, how stand-up meetings should be run, and how short, structured, and focused activities can increase productivity. It showed that efficiency is not just about doing more work, but about doing the right activities with clear structure, alignment, and communication.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
From this learning, I gained a better understanding of how good leadership and team organisation affect project success. This will be valuable when working with others in industry settings, especially when group projects require fast decision-making and shared understanding. Knowing how to communicate clearly, participate properly in stand-ups, and collaborate effectively will help me work better in future professional Agile teams.
