## Week 8 - WordPress: Developing Custom Themes
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I conducted a learning experiment using the scientific method, and I also continued studying WordPress theme development and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles

## Learning Experiment (Scientific Method)
### Hypothesis
If I take structured notes while learning technical topics (instead of only watching the lessons), I will understand and remember the material more effectively.

### Experiment / Test
### 1.	Choose two learning tasks
o	Task A: Watch a section of the WordPress theme development tutorial without taking notes
o	Task B: Watch a section of the DRY development tutorial while taking structured notes

### 2.	After each task
After finishing each video:
o	Write a short summary from memory
o	Attempt a small exercise (e.g., modifying a WordPress function, or reorganising repeated code into reusable components)

### 3.	Compare Performance
Measured using:
o	Clarity of summary
o	Mistakes made during the exercise
o	Confidence in explaining the concept afterwards

### 4.	Results
o	My summary after taking notes was clearer and contained more accurate details
o	I made fewer mistakes while applying DRY concepts in the WordPress code
o	I felt more confident explaining what DRY means and how it improves theme development

## Conclusion:
The hypothesis is supported - taking structured notes significantly improved my understanding and retention of the material.

## Estimated Hours
6 hours

## Content Insights
From the WordPress tutorials, I learned how a custom theme is built from the ground up, including setting up a development environment, working with templates, and using modular components to structure a theme properly. I also developed a better understanding of the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) development principle, which focuses on reducing duplicate code and improving maintainability. Applying DRY inside WordPress-such as by reusing template parts, functions, and custom modules-helps create cleaner and more scalable websites.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week's learning reinforced how important clean coding practices are in real development environments. DRY principles are widely used in professional software engineering, and being able to apply them in WordPress makes me more prepared for real-world web development work. The experiment also showed me that improving how I learn can increase my efficiency when studying new frameworks or technologies. This encourages me to adopt more active-learning strategies for future projects, especially when dealing with larger and more complex codebases.
