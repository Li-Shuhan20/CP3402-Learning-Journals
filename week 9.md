## Week 7 - PHP Programming
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I studied the basics of Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) through a LinkedIn Learning course, focusing on installation, setup, and introductory features of the language.

## Estimated Hours
5 hours

## Content Insights
From the tutorial, I learned how Sass extends CSS with more powerful features such as variables, nesting, partials, mixins, and lists. These tools make styling more organised and efficient compared to writing plain CSS. I also gained a basic understanding of the workflow, including how to compile Sass into standard CSS and how comments, colours, and list elements can be handled more effectively. Although I have only touched the fundamentals, I can already see how Sass can simplify large or complex stylesheets, and I plan to explore more advanced features later.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Learning Sass helped me understand how modern front-end developers manage and structure their CSS more professionally. These skills are valuable in real-world projects where maintainability and scalability are important, especially when working in teams. Knowing how to use Sass can also improve my workflow when designing WordPress themes or building responsive layouts, making me more efficient and capable in future web development roles. This week also reminded me that learning tools that improve productivity is just as important as learning new programming languages.
