## Content Insights
I learned how PHP uses variables, operators, and functions to create dynamic and interactive web content. The lessons also explained how PHP scripts can communicate with a MySQL database to store and retrieve information across different pages. Understanding how backend logic works behind a website gave me a clearer picture of how data is processed and managed on the server side.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Learning PHP and MySQL helped me understand the foundation of many modern web applications. These skills are essential for full-stack development and can improve my ability to build data-driven websites. Knowing how to integrate backend programming with front-end design will make me more adaptable in future web development roles and better prepared to collaborate with both designers and database administrators.
