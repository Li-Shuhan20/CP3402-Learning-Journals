## Week 4 - Development and deployment workflows
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I continued learning WordPress and also explored resources about modern web design processes and version control collaboration. I watched two LinkedIn Learning videos to understand how web design goals relate to user experience, and how to use GitHub to collaborate effectively with others on shared projects.

## Content Insights
From these lessons, I learned that modern web design is not just about building pages — it is about understanding user behaviour, gathering feedback, and improving design based on different user perspectives. I also learned that version control (especially with GitHub) supports modular development and allows team members to track changes, submit updates, and avoid conflicts when working together on a website or software project.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week's learning helped me realise that user experience should always guide design decisions, and that delivering a website that truly meets user needs requires continuous iteration and listening to feedback. At the same time, developing collaboration habits with tools like GitHub is an essential skill for industry teamwork. Knowing how to work in structured, shared repositories will be important not only for academic group assignments, but also for future workplace environments where efficient cooperation is required.
