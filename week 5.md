## Week 5 - WordPress: Developing Child Themes

This week, I explored how to customise WordPress websites using child themes, and I also learned about responsive web design directly in the browser. I followed LinkedIn Learning tutorials that introduced how child themes work and how responsive design can be tested and adjusted more efficiently during development.

## Content Insights
I learned how child themes allow developers to modify, style, and personalise a WordPress site without changing the original theme files. This gives flexibility and creative freedom to make a site look more modern and unique. I also learned that designing responsive layouts directly in the browser allows faster testing and visual adjustments, which can improve the speed of the design process and help ensure the site works better across different screen sizes.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Understanding child themes and responsive design is important for professional web development work. These skills can make websites more adaptable, attractive, and easier to maintain. I realised that being able to efficiently control design details and test responsiveness early can help deliver higher-quality results in real projects. These techniques will be useful in future web development roles, and they will support my growth towards becoming more confident in front-end and CMS-based design work.
